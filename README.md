# üçΩÔ∏è React Restaurant Website - Azure Deployment Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step process to deploy the React Restaurant Website on an **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)** using Docker. You'll learn how to set up the Azure VM, install Docker, and run the application.

---

## üöÄ Quick Overview

- **Tech Stack**: React, Node.js, NGINX
- **Deployment**: Docker on Azure VM
- **Repository**: [React Restaurant Website Theme](https://github.com/walifile/react-resturant-website-theme.git)

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An **Azure account** with permissions to create resources.
- **Azure Virtual Machine** with at least **8 GB RAM** (we'll cover the setup).
- Basic knowledge of Azure and terminal commands.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Up an Azure Virtual Machine

#### 1.1 Create a New Virtual Machine

1. **Log in to the Azure Portal**:  
   Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in to your account.

2. **Navigate to Virtual Machines**:  
   In the left sidebar, click on **"Virtual machines"**, then click **"Create"** > **"Azure virtual machine"**.

3. **Configure Basic Settings**:
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group or use an existing one.
   - **Virtual Machine Name**: Choose a name (e.g., `react-restaurant-vm`).
   - **Region**: Select a region close to you.
   - **Image**: Choose **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS**.
   - **Size**: Select a VM size with at least **8 GB RAM** (e.g., **Standard DS2 v2**).

4. **Set Administrator Account**:
   - **Authentication Type**: Choose **SSH public key**.
   - **Username**: Enter your desired username.
   - **SSH public key source**: Use existing public key
   - **SSH Public Key**: Paste your public SSH key.

5. **Configure Inbound Port Rules**:
   - **Public Inbound Ports**: Select **Allow selected ports**.
   - **Select Inbound Ports**: Choose **SSH (22)** and **HTTP (80)**.

6. **Review and Create**:
   - Click **"Review + create"**.
   - Review the settings and click **"Create"**.

#### 1.2 Obtain the Public IP Address

- After deployment, navigate to your VM and note the **Public IP address**. You'll need this to connect via SSH and to access the website.

---

### Step 2: Connect to Your Azure VM via SSH

1. **Open Terminal**: On your local machine.

2. **Connect to the VM**:
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<public_ip_address>
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your VM's username and `<public_ip_address>` with your VM's public IP.

---

### Step 3: Install Docker on the Azure VM

1. **Update System Packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Docker**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y docker.io
   ```

3. **Change the owner for docker**:
   ```bash
   sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

4. **Verify Docker Installation**:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

---

### Step 4: Clone the Repository on the VM

1. **Clone the Project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/walifile/react-resturant-website-theme.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd react-resturant-website-theme
   ```

---

### Step 5: Create the Dockerfile on the VM

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   ```bash
   nano Dockerfile
   ```

2. **Paste the Following Code** into the `Dockerfile`:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use an official Node runtime as a base image for building the app
   FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install frontend dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Update browserslist database
   RUN npx update-browserslist-db@latest

   # Set environment variable to enable legacy OpenSSL support
   ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

   # Copy the rest of the application files to the container
   COPY . .

   # Build the frontend app
   RUN npm run build

   # Use NGINX as a lightweight base image to serve the app
   FROM nginx:alpine

   # Copy the built app from the previous stage
   COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

   # Expose port 80 to the outside world (default for HTTP)
   EXPOSE 80

   # Start NGINX server
   CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
   ```

3. **Save the Dockerfile** and exit (`Ctrl + s`, then `Ctrl + x` to exit).

---

### Step 6: Build the Docker Image on the VM

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t react-restaurant-site .
   ```
   This command builds the Docker image and tags it as `react-restaurant-site`.

---

### Step 7: Run the Docker Container on the VM

1. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 react-restaurant-site
   ```
   - `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
   - `-p 80:80`: Maps port `80` of the VM to port `80` of the container.

2. **Verify the Container is Running**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   You should see `react-restaurant-site` listed.

---

### Step 8: Configure Azure Network Security Group (if needed)

If you didn't open port `80` during VM creation, you need to allow inbound traffic on port `80`.

1. **Navigate to Your VM** in the Azure Portal.

2. **Click on "Networking"** in the sidebar.

3. **Add Inbound Port Rule**:
   - **Destination port ranges**: `80`
   - **Protocol**: `TCP`
   - **Action**: `Allow`
   - **Priority**: A number (e.g., `1000`)
   - **Name**: `Allow-HTTP`

4. **Save** the rule.

---

### Step 9: Access the Deployed Website

1. **Open Your Web Browser**.

2. **Navigate to**:
   ```
   http://<public_ip_address>
   ```
   Replace `<public_ip_address>` with your VM's public IP.

3. **You Should See the React Restaurant Website!**

---

## üìÇ Additional Docker Commands

- **List Running Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

- **Stop a Running Container**:
   ```bash
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```

- **Remove a Container**:
   ```bash
   docker rm <container_id>
   ```

- **View Docker Images**:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Port Already in Use**:  
  If you encounter an error that port `80` is already in use, try using a different port:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 react-restaurant-site
  ```
  Then, ensure that port `8080` is allowed in the Azure Network Security Group and access the site via `http://<public_ip_address>:8080`.

- **Permission Denied Errors**:  
  Ensure your user is added to the Docker group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```

  Then, log out and log back in.
  Or
  ```bash
  sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock
  ```


- **Docker Build Fails**:  
  Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and that you're connected to the internet.

---

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Firewall Rules**:  
  Opening ports to the internet can expose your VM to security risks. Ensure you only open necessary ports and consider using Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups for added security.

- **Updates**:  
  Regularly update your system packages and Docker to the latest versions.
